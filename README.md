###  eSpatial: a computational framework to decode the spatially divergent combinations of enhancers 

------



## Introduction:

eSpatial is a computational framework to decode gene expression regulation by the spatially divergent combinations of enhancers through integrating spatial profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. 

### Workflow:

Briefly, it contains the following seven steps: 

**Step 1. Prepare input matrix (Input)**

**Step 2. Reduce dimension and construct spatial neighbor network (Preprocessing)**

**Step 3. Detect spatial domains**

**Step 4. Identify spatial-specific genes and cis-regulatory elements (sGEs/sCREs)**

**Step 5. Define enhancer clusters of genes**

**Step 6. Depict spatial patterns of enhancers for** **genes expressed in multiple spatial domains**

**Step 7. Decode the combinations of spatially divergent enhancers**
